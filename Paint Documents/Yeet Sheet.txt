#Service "Auction House" (marketplace)
- A website where people post listings for services or goods they need.
- Users can respond with their bids on other posts
- Heavy frontend magic <- Focus


Think of security!


TO-DO / FIX LIST:

- Fix title to include "'s profile" in currentUserProfile.html

- Notifications on listings with unread comments

- Fix "Go To Listing" button when viewing somebody else's profile, so you can't delete their listings
